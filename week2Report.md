Write a web server called StringServer that supports the path and behavior described below. It should keep track of a single string that gets added to by incoming requests. The requests should look like this:

/add-message?s=<string>
The effect of this request is to concatenate a new line (\n) and the string after = to the running string, and then respond with the entire string so far.

So, for example, after

/add-message?s=Hello
The page should show

Hello
and after

/add-message?s=How are you
the page should show

Hello
How are you
Show the code for your StringServer, and two screenshots of using /add-message.

For each of the two screenshots, describe:

Which methods in your code are called?
What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?
How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.
By values, we mean specific Strings, ints, URIs, and so on. "abc" is a value, 456 is a value, new URI("http://...") is a value, and so on.)

Part 2
Choose one of the bugs from lab 3.

Provide:

A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
An input that doesn’t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.

Part 3
In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from lab in week 2 or 3 that you didn’t know before.
